The bodysuit’s surface is covered with an assortment of interface ports and connections to connect the wearer with the Power Armor frame, over it. The Brotherhood of Steel employ these as the base of their standard uniforms, ensuring that as many of their personnel as possible are ready to wear full armor.

motorbike, while still being reasonably comfortable in
any temperate or cold climate."
Clothing,Tough Clothing,1,1,0,"Arms, Legs, Torso",3,20,1,"Hard-wearing clothing cobbled together from sufficiently sturdy garments to create an outfit that can withstand a hard life in the wasteland.

Outfit,Brotherhood Scribe's Armor,1,2,2,"Arms, Legs, Torso",4,20,2,"The Scribes of the Brotherhood of Steel are sometimes required to venture out into the field to make observations or perform research up-close.

Outfit,Cage Armor,3,4,0,"Head, Arms, Legs, Torso",33,110,3,"Heavy leather clothing, reinforced with rags, metal plates, chains, and bars.

impression.

you make each scene.

Headgear,Formal Hat,0,0,0,Head,<1,15,2,"A smart-looking hat, that’ll look the part adorning your head during a business engagement or formal event. Or just because you like how it looks and it keeps the sun off your face. Many examples are somewhat battered and worn from neglect and ill-use, but they’re still functional.

Headgear,Welder's Visor,2,2,0,Head,4,20,2,"A reinforced cap with a metal faceplate. The faceplate contains a piece of hardened tinted glass, to protect the eyes when operating welding equipment, and it can be raised and lowered as needed.
